To answer your question bluntly: yes, I do worry about the chaos we're creating. I know that our masters are members of House Gol, but in all honesty, the fact that they're hiring us makes them traitors to their own House. Though they have never indicated that they are working for another, I imagine that they are most likely in the service of yet another faction. Perhaps House Forcan? They would have much to gain if Gol fell into a war along its western border.</em>\r\n\r\nStunning news indeed.

Judging from this letter and Trindan's earlier musings, though, there may be more cells active, carrying out who-knows-what schemes.\r\n\r\nAt last, you look through Trindan's personal effects. He didn't carry anything that would have betrayed his own affiliation to House Hansa, but you do find a cryptic reference to a cave in House Engoth.

You read through the entire book in close detail.\r\n\r\nSonomin was the great-great-great grandfather of Sedoron, who would one day become the King of Lok. Sonomin had a natural talent for working with ether, though he was wise enough to make sure that only his most trusted relatives knew of it. At that time, ether was even more feared than today. A commoner accused of practicing ether would be blamed for all sorts of natural misfortunes and lynched. A member of a House wouldn't suffer such a fate, but would lose influence among the family. Sonomin's secrecy allowed him to remain in the line of succession, and he eventually became Patriarch.\r\n\r\nPatriarch Sonomin couldn't gain much direct advantage over manipulation of ether, but he foresaw that this feared skill could one day provide a  boon to his House. Therefore, Sonomin started a House school. Officially, it would teach topics like military tactics and cryptography. However, Sonomin quietly hired etherists as well, who shared knowledge amongst themselves and sought to refine their techniques.\r\n\r\nAfter Sonomin's passing, the school gradually evolved into today's lyceum. While the Kingdom has never officially acknowledged Sonomin's talents, his crucial patronage has led to the relatively close ties the Kingdom has with etherists. Their talents directly contributed to Sedoron's rise to supremacy, and they continue to honor Sonomin as the First Etherist.
