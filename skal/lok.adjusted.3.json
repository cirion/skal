The author claims that ether is created by superior beings who live in the sky, that one must recite special words in order to tap its powers, that mastering ether allows one to create new animals and predict the future. You don't consider yourself an expert of ether, and even you know this is all false. In fact, you come to the conclusion that several other arguments made by the author are false, and glumly toss the book in the gutter after satisfying your curiosity.", "weight": 1, "choice": 28}}, {"pk": 30, "model": "lok.result", "fields": {"title": "Dusty Wisdom", "type": 1, "description": "The diagrams within the book are quite useful, albeit rather familiar.
